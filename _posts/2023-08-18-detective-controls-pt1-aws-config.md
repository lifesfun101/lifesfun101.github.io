This hands-on lab will walk you through how to set up a AWS Config using Terraform. 

AWS Config is a powerful tool that lets you record, assess, and manage resource configurations and relationships within your AWS environment and monitor how these gradually change over time. With AWS Config, one can gain greater visibility and control over their infrastructure, streamline resource management, and identify and remediate security vulnerabilities. 

Additionally, AWS Config can help organizations ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations by providing detailed auditing and reporting features. Whether you are managing a small AWS deployment or a large, complex infrastructure, AWS Config can help simplify your operations and improve your security posture.

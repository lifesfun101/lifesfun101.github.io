<div class="about">
  <p>This blog started as a record of my OSCP journey — a mix of excitement, frustration, and those long days of “try harder.” Since then, I’ve spent years diving deep into cybersecurity from every angle: offensive testing, defensive engineering and managerial.</p>
  <p> Today, I use this space — along with my YouTube channel — to simplify complex topics and make technical learning more practical and enjoyable. Whether it’s building with Terraform, securing AWS environments, or walking through pentesting fundamentals, everything here comes from real work and real curiosity. </p>
  <p> I still learn every day, and this blog continues to evolve with that same spirit.</p>

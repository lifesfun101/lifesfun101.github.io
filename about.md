<div class="about">
	<p>I'm a young information security professional who enjoys tough problems to solve and new challenges to take on. 
  I have graduated from college with Information Security Degree and have always been fascinated with this area of Information Technology. 
  In the past I have been on the defensive side of security, working in a Security Operations Center as a Security Analyst.</p>
  <p>Inspiration for this blog came from a long but fun journey of obtaining OSCP certificate. 
  Once I glimpsed into the defensive spectrum of cybersecurity, I always wanted to know what the other side was like.
  Throughout the journey I had to read, google a lot and try harder and smarter. 
  I stumbled upon other people's books, blogs, posts and articles but I was not able to find one centralized resource for all my needs.
  As a result I decided to make my own.</p> 
  <p>I really hope my contributions on this page will help others along the way and save them quite some time as well.</p>
